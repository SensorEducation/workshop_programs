#Loop Introduction
"""

A loop in programming is a certain area of code that gets ran over
and over again until something tells it to stop.  Think of it like Newtons
A loop in execution will stay in execution until another bit of code stops it.
"""

"""
Just as we discussed with variables, there are different types of loops.
Today we will be working with a WHILE loop which is the simplest form of
a loop, only one condition must be met for it to run.
"""







"""
What do you notice about the two loops?

The condition inside of the parenthesis must be TRUE for the loop to run.
As you saw, theres nothing that changes the True to be False so the first
loop goes on forever.

There are ways to manipulate the condition so make
the loop run as many timea as you want!
"""


#Assign counter an integer digit
counter = 1
#Assign runCount an integer digit greater than runCount
runCount = 10
while(counter < runCount):
    print("number")
    runCount +=1
    


#Press F5 to save and run your program    

"""
How many times did your star print?

We used two variables to start the condition as true, then added 1 to
one variable every time the loop ran to eventually make the condition false.

There are numerous ways to change the variables inside the condition and
inside the loop, try making your own below and run your program.
